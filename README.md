WEARABLE TEXTILE METAMATERIAL VIVALDI ANTENNA ARRAY FOR BREAST TUMOR

Purpose: 

The proposed paper introduces a groundbreaking method for breast tumor detection employing wearable textile metamaterial Vivaldi antenna arrays. These antennas, crafted on a cotton substrate infused with jean cloth metamaterial, not only enhance efficiency but also prioritize patient comfort during detection procedures. By harnessing the wideband capabilities of Vivaldi antennas, the design seamlessly integrates with the innovative metamaterial, thereby elevating performance for medical applications. Two sets of antennas, named Antenna 1 and Antenna 2, undergo meticulous design and analysis using HFSS software. While Antenna 1 serves as the baseline, Antenna 2 incorporates strategic modifications, including the addition of Circle 1 and Circle 2 structures and the integration of Circle 3 in the inner patch region. Simulation results highlight substantial enhancements in radiation characteristics and impedance matching properties in Antenna 2 over Antenna 1. Operating within the 2.4 GHz band, both antennas exhibit low specific absorption rates (SAR) at 1g and 10g, ensuring wearer safety and comfort. This proposed wearable textile metamaterial Vivaldi antenna arrays present a promising avenue for revolutionizing breast tumor detection, offering a more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective alternative to conventional methods.
